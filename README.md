Exploring genderless names at birth in Nantes (2001-2022)

Hello! 👶🧒🍼🇫🇷
I recently had the opportunity to dive into the birth data for Nantes, and discovered something fascinating: genderless first names. This exploration of the diversity of first names used in the city gave us a better understanding of how parents are changing traditional gender norms and promoting equality.

I invite you to read my latest publication, in which I share my findings on genderless first names used in Nantes from 2001 to 2022. You'll find an in-depth analysis and interesting visualizations highlighting this growing trend.
